Transportation problem is solved by many method. We instroduce some methods to solve this problem without using linear programming.
1) Method to find basis frist solution:
	+ Northwest corner method
	+ Least cost method
	+ Vogel approximation method
These three method is coded with matlab namely (NCM, LCM, VOGELMETHOD)
To run from begin 'RunFile.m'
Output will be generate 'route.txt' which is the bfs

2) Method to optimize bfs:
	+ Modi method
Using python
Run 'MODI_METHOD.py' to run. Note that algorithm solved the path in 'route.txt'
