Transportation problem is solved by many method. We instroduce some methods to solve this problem without using linear programming.
1) Method to find basis frist solution:
	+ Northwest corner method
	+ Least cost method
	+ <p>Vogel approximation method</p>
These three method is coded with matlab namely (NCM, LCM, VOGELMETHOD)
To run from begin 'RunFile.m'
Output will be generate 'route.txt' which is the bfs

2) Method to optimize bfs:
	+ <p>Modi method.</p>

Run 'MODI_METHOD.py' to run. Note that algorithm solved the path in 'route.txt'
